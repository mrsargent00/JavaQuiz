# JavaQuiz

# Description
This was suppose to be an interactive quiz with a timer, and a place to store data locally with initals of the attempts. I cannot seem to get the timer to work regardless of what I do, and I cant sem to link it locally. These are the issues I am facing with this challenge. I know I can submit it for a better grade down the line, and will probably polish it up more so that it could get a better grade than what it will be given. I had extreme challenge with this "build a quiz" assignment and has given me great pain on how it looks, I love to push myself with everything I do, but cannot seem to get this to match the example that was given to us on the module.

I also used a lot of code examples from the MSU-VIRT class to help build it what it is currently. 

# Usage.

The above photo shows what the quiz currently looks like, the answer has to be clicked, then hit submit, at the end of the quiz, it will tell you how many are incorrect, but wont tell you which question is incorrect.
