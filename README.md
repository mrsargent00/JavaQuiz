# JavaQuiz

# Description
This was suppose to be an interactive quiz with a timer, and a place to store data locally with initals of the attempts. I cannot seem to get the timer to work regardless of what I do, and I cant sem to link it locally. These are the issues I am facing with this challenge. I know I can submit it for a better grade down the line, and will probably polish it up more so that it could get a better grade than what it will be given. I had extreme challenge with this "build a quiz" assignment and has given me great pain on how it looks, I love to push myself with everything I do, but cannot seem to get this to match the example that was given to us on the module.
